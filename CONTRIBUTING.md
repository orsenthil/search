### <a name="submit-pr"></a> Submitting a Pull Request (PR)
Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

* Search the repository (https://github.com/orsenthil/search/pulls) for an open or closed PR
  that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.

* Make your changes in a new git fork:

* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* Push your fork to GitHub:
* In GitHub, create a pull request
* If we suggest changes then:
  * Make the required updates.
  * Rebase your fork and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!
